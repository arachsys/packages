Usage: pkg ACTION [ARG]...

pkg apply [-d DIR] [-p STRIP] PATCH
  Apply a patch from a remote URL or local file.

pkg build [-d] PKG [FEATURE]...
  Build an image for package PKG in the configured image directory $IMGDIR,
  constructing and using a temporary build chroot consisting of the base
  packages plus any additional build requirements PKG declares. Images for
  all the build requirements and base packages must already exist in the
  image directory. Any existing image for PKG is replaced on successful
  completion; otherwise it is untouched. Use -d to enable debug mode, which
  leaves the build chroot in place for inspection whether or not the build
  succeeds, and does not install the new image in $IMGDIR.

pkg hashtree [DIR [EXCLUDE]...]
  Generate a hash of the source code in directory DIR, skipping paths which
  match any EXCLUDE pattern. When DIR is unspecified, the current directory
  is used. File contents, executability and path names are hashed, together
  with symlinks and directories, but timestamps, ownerships and permissions
  do not affect the result. Out-of-tree symlinks, pipes, sockets and device
  nodes are forbidden as a security risk and will result in an error.

pkg make [-d] [-s SRC] PKG DST [FEATURE]...
  In the directory DST, which must be empty, build an image for package PKG
  with the specified FEATURE options. All the base packages plus any build
  requirements should already be installed on the host. An empty directory
  or pre-prepared tree of source code for building can be provided with the
  -s option. Use -d to enable debug mode, which leaves the build tree in
  place for inspection whether or not the build succeeds.

pkg prepare PKG SRC [FEATURE]...
  In the directory SRC, which must be empty, unpack and patch the source
  code for package PKG with the specified FEATURE options. Preparation will
  stop at the first error, leaving the partial source tree for debugging.

pkg requirements PKG [FEATURE]...
  List the build requirements for PKG with specified FEATURE options.

pkg root [PKG]...
  Start a login shell in a temporary chroot constructed from the images in
  $IMGDIR, containing the base packages plus the specified additions. The
  temporary root filesystem is deleted when the shell exits.

pkg unpack [-d DIR] [-p STRIP] PATCH
  Unpack a source tree tar file from a remote URL or local file.

Set the package source tree location with environment variable PKGDIR, the
image directory with IMGDIR and the download cache directory with CACHEDIR.
