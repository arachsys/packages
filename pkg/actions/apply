Usage: ${0##*/} apply [-c CACHEDIR] [-d DIR] [-p STRIP] PATCH

Apply a patch from a remote URL or local file to the current directory
or the directory specified with the -d option. By default, one leading
component is stripped from filenames when applying patches but this can
be adjusted with the -p option. An optional cache directory for downloads
can be provided with the -c option.
