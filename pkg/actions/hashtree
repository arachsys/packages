Usage: ${0##*/} hashtree DIR [EXCLUDE]...

Generate a hash of the source code in directory DIR, skipping paths which
match any EXCLUDE pattern. When DIR is unspecified, the current directory
is used. File contents, executability and path names are hashed, together
with symlinks and directories, but timestamps, ownerships and permissions
do not affect the result. Out-of-tree symlinks, pipes, sockets and device
nodes are forbidden as a security risk and will result in an error.
