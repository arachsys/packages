Usage: pkg ACTION [ARG]...

pkg apply [-d DIR] [-p STRIP] PATCH
  Apply a patch from a remote URL or local file.

pkg build [-o OUTDIR] [-s SRC] PKG [FEATURE]...
  Build an image for package PKG with the specified FEATURE options in the
  configured image directory $IMGDIR. Images for all the build requirements
  and base packages must already exist in the image directory. Any existing
  image for PKG is replaced on successful completion; otherwise it is
  untouched. An alternative output directory to $IMGDIR can be specified
  with the -o option, and a pre-prepared tree of source code to build can
  be provided with the -s option.

pkg check [-p JOBS] [PKG]...
  Check for upstream updates of each package PKG using PKG/check. If no
  arguments are given, check every package in $PKGDIR. By default, up to 16
  packages will be checked concurrently: use -p JOBS to change this limit.

pkg hashtree [DIR [EXCLUDE]...]
  Generate a hash of the source code in directory DIR, skipping paths which
  match any EXCLUDE pattern. When DIR is unspecified, the current directory
  is used. File contents, executability and path names are hashed, together
  with symlinks and directories, but timestamps, ownerships and permissions
  do not affect the result. Out-of-tree symlinks, pipes, sockets and device
  nodes are forbidden as a security risk and will result in an error.

pkg prepare PKG SRC [FEATURE]...
  In the directory SRC, which must not already exist, unpack and patch the
  sources for package PKG with the specified FEATURE options. Preparation
  stops at the first error, leaving the partial source tree for debugging.

pkg requirements PKG [FEATURE]...
  List the build requirements for PKG with the specified FEATURE options.

pkg resolve [PKG]...
  Expand the specified package image list by recursively adding runtime
  requirements and the base packages. Run without arguments, pkg resolve
  returns the standard build requirements.

pkg shell [-s SRC] [PKG]... [-- CMD [ARG]...]
  Start a login shell or other command in a temporary chroot constructed
  from the images in $IMGDIR, including the base packages, specified
  additions and their runtime requirements. If none are listed, the
  standard build requirements are used. A source tree to bind at /src can
  be provided with the -s option. The temporary root filesystem is deleted
  when the shell exits.

pkg system DIR [PKG]...
  Construct a system image in DIR from package images in $IMGDIR, including
  the base packages, specified additions and their runtime requirements. If
  none are listed, the standard build requirements are used. DIR must not
  already exist.

pkg unpack [-d DIR] [-p STRIP] TARFILE
  Unpack a source tree tar file from a remote URL or local file.

Set the package source tree location with environment variable PKGDIR, the
image directory with IMGDIR and the download cache directory with CACHEDIR.
