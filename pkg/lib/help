Usage: pkg ACTION [ARG]...

pkg apply [-d DIR] [-p STRIP] PATCH
  Apply a patch from a remote URL or local file.

pkg build [-d] [-s SRC] PKG [FEATURE]...
  Build an image for package PKG with the specified FEATURE options in the
  configured image directory $IMGDIR. Images for all the build requirements
  and base packages must already exist in the image directory. Any existing
  image for PKG is replaced on successful completion; otherwise it is
  untouched. An empty directory or pre-prepared tree of source code for
  building can be provided with the -s option. Use -d to enable debug mode,
  which leaves the build chroot in place for inspection whether or not the
  build succeeds, and does not install the new image in $IMGDIR.

pkg check [-p JOBS] [PKG]...
  Check for upstream updates of each package PKG using PKG/check. If no
  arguments are given, check every package in $PKGDIR. By default, up to 16
  packages will be checked concurrently: use -p JOBS to change this limit.

pkg hashtree [DIR [EXCLUDE]...]
  Generate a hash of the source code in directory DIR, skipping paths which
  match any EXCLUDE pattern. When DIR is unspecified, the current directory
  is used. File contents, executability and path names are hashed, together
  with symlinks and directories, but timestamps, ownerships and permissions
  do not affect the result. Out-of-tree symlinks, pipes, sockets and device
  nodes are forbidden as a security risk and will result in an error.

pkg prepare PKG SRC [FEATURE]...
  In the directory SRC, which must not already exist, unpack and patch the
  sources for package PKG with the specified FEATURE options. Preparation
  stops at the first error, leaving the partial source tree for debugging.

pkg requirements PKG [FEATURE]...
  List the build requirements for PKG with the specified FEATURE options.

pkg shell [PKG]...
  Start a login shell in a temporary chroot constructed from the images in
  $IMGDIR, containing the base packages plus any specified additions. The
  temporary root filesystem is deleted when the shell exits.

pkg system [-i] [-p] [-t TEMPLATE] DIR [PKG]...
  Construct a bootstrap system image in DIR from package images in $IMGDIR,
  containing the base packages plus any specified additions. DIR must not
  already exist. If DIR is of the form FILE.tar[.gz|.bz2|.xz|.zstd], a tar
  archive is generated instead of a directory. The system can be populated
  from a template directory using -t TEMPLATE. Use -i to hard-link included
  images into /home/root/img. Use -p to copy the whole package recipe tree
  from $PKGDIR into /home/root/pkg.

pkg unpack [-d DIR] [-p STRIP] PATCH
  Unpack a source tree tar file from a remote URL or local file.

Set the package source tree location with environment variable PKGDIR, the
image directory with IMGDIR and the download cache directory with CACHEDIR.
