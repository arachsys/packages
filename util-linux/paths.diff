 == DESCRIPTION
 
-*fsck* is used to check and optionally repair one or more Linux filesystems. _filesystem_ can be a device name (e.g., _/dev/hdc1_, _/dev/sdb2_), a mount point (e.g., _/_, _/usr_, _/home_), or an filesystem label or UUID specifier (e.g., UUID=8868abf6-88c5-4a83-98b8-bfc24057f7bd or LABEL=root). Normally, the *fsck* program will try to handle filesystems on different physical disk drives in parallel to reduce the total amount of time needed to check all of them.
+*fsck* is used to check and optionally repair one or more Linux filesystems. _filesystem_ can be a device name (e.g., _/dev/hdc1_, _/dev/sdb2_), a mount point (e.g., _/_, _/var_, _/home_), or an filesystem label or UUID specifier (e.g., UUID=8868abf6-88c5-4a83-98b8-bfc24057f7bd or LABEL=root). Normally, the *fsck* program will try to handle filesystems on different physical disk drives in parallel to reduce the total amount of time needed to check all of them.
 
 If no filesystems are specified on the command line, and the *-A* option is not specified, *fsck* will default to checking filesystems in _/etc/fstab_ serially. This is equivalent to the *-As* options.

 //TRANSLATORS: Keep {plus} untranslated.
 There are two separate databases in the zoneinfo system, posix and 'right'. 'Right' (now named zoneinfo-leaps) includes leap seconds and posix does not. To use the 'right' database the System Clock must be set to (UTC {plus} leap seconds), which is equivalent to (TAI - 10). This allows calculating the exact number of seconds between two dates that cross a leap second epoch. The System Clock is then converted to the correct civil time, including UTC, by using the 'right' timezone files which subtract the leap seconds. Note: this configuration is considered experimental and is known to have issues.
 
-To configure a system to use a particular database all of the files located in its directory must be copied to the root of _/usr/share/zoneinfo_. Files are never used directly from the posix or 'right' subdirectories, e.g., TZ='_right/Europe/Dublin_'. This habit was becoming so common that the upstream zoneinfo project restructured the system's file tree by moving the posix and 'right' subdirectories out of the zoneinfo directory and into sibling directories:

This causes the system timezone to be configured to include leap seconds while the zoneinfo database is still configured to exclude them. Then when an application such as a World Clock needs the South_Pole timezone file; or an email MTA, or *hwclock* needs the UTC timezone file; they fetch it from the root of _/usr/share/zoneinfo_ , because that is what they are supposed to do. Those files exclude leap seconds, but the System Clock now includes them, causing an incorrect time conversion.
